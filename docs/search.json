    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe United States has long been a focal point for political studies, and its elections are often seen as a reflection of broader societal dynamics. What fascinates us most is how electoral outcomes are not just determined at the state level, as popularly perceived, but also exhibit nuanced and often striking trends at the county level. After conducting preliminary research, we noticed consistent patterns in voting behavior that align with specific socioeconomic factors, even when accounting for regional diversity.\nWe are interested in exploring the relationship between these socioeconomic indicators and the presidential election majorities at the county level. For instance, how do income disparities correlate with shifts in political preferences? Are counties with higher poverty rates more likely to lean toward one political party, and how has this evolved over time? Similarly, we want to investigate whether education levels or employment rates play a more significant role in shaping voter turnout and preferences in certain regions. By focusing on granular data at the county level, we aim to uncover how local socioeconomic conditions contribute to the broader political landscape.",

    "text": "The dataset, countypres_2000-2020.csv, provides county-level presidential election returns from 2000 to 2020. It is sourced from official state election data records and hosted on the Harvard Dataverse. The dataset was last updated on June 8, 2021.\nThe dataset, Education.csv, provides information on county-level educational attainment data from 1970 to 2022. It is sourced from the USDA Economic Research Service’s County-Level Data Sets, available USDA. The dataset was last updated on June 20, 2024.\nThe dataset, Unemployment.csv, provides county-level unemployment rates from 2000 to 2022. It is sourced from the USDA Economic Research Service’s County-Level Data Sets, available USDA. The dataset was last updated on June 20, 2024.\nThe datasets: est04ALL.csv, est08ALL.csv, est12ALL.csv, est16ALL.csv, est20ALL.csv, provide annual Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) for counties in the United States. These datasets are sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau’s SAIPE program and are available SAIPE. The datasets were last updated on October 8, 2021\n\n\n2.1.1 Data Overview\n\nThe dataset, countypres_2000-2020.csv, contains the following variables:\n\n\nyear: election year\nstate: state name\nstate_po: U.S. postal code state abbreviation\ncounty_name: county name\ncounty_fips: county FIPS code\noffice: President\ncandidate: name of the candidate\nparty: party of the candidate; takes form of DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN, GREEN, LIBERTARIAN, or OTHER\ncandidatevotes: votes received by this candidate for this particular party\ntotalvotes: total number of votes cast in this county-year\nmode: mode of ballots cast; default is TOTAL, with different modes specified for 2020\nversion: date when dataset was finalized\n\n\nThe dataset, Education.csv, contains the following variables:\n\n\nFIPS Code: FIPS code\nState: state abbreviation\nArea name: name of state or county\nAttribute: educational metric\nValue: The corresponding value for the educational metric, typically as a percentage or count\n\n\nThe dataset, Unemployment.csv, contains the following variables:\n\n\nFIPS_Code: FIPS code\nState: state abbreviation\nArea_Name: name of state or county\nAttribute: unemployment-related metric\nValue: The corresponding value for the unemployment metric, typically as a percentage or count\n\n\nThe datasets, estxxALL.csv, contain the following variables:\n\n\nState FIPS: state FIPS code\nCounty FIPS: county FIPS code\nPostal: U.S. postal code state abbreviation\nName: name of the county\nPoverty Estimate All Ages: estimated number of people of all ages living in poverty\nPoverty Percent All Ages: estimated percentage of people of all ages living in poverty\nPoverty Estimate Under Age 18: estimated number of children under 18 living in poverty\nPoverty Percent Under Age 18: estimated percentage of children under 18 living in poverty\nPoverty Estimate Ages 5-17: estimated number of children aged 5-17 living in poverty\nPoverty Percent Ages 5-17: estimated percentage of children aged 5-17 living in poverty\nMedian Household Income: estimated median household income for the county\nPoverty Estimate Ages 0-4: estimated number of children aged 0-4 living in poverty\nPoverty Percent Ages 0-4: estimated percentage of children aged 0-4 living in poverty\n90% CI Lower Bound: lower bound of the 90% confidence interval for poverty estimates\n90% CI Upper Bound: upper bound of the 90% confidence interval for poverty estimates\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Issues or Problems\n\ncountypres_2000-2020.csv: County results in Alaska for 2004 are based on official Alaska data, but it is clear the district returns significantly overstate the number of votes cast. In Alaska, the county_fips field stores a combination of state FIPS code and district.\nEducation.csv: Some attribute labels are ambiguous and may require clarification or mapping to standardized educational metrics.\nUnemployment.csv: Inconsistencies in the naming of attributes could pose challenges in aligning the data with other sources.\nestxxALL.csv: Attribute labels may vary slightly across years, requiring careful alignment when merging multiple years.\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Data Import Plan\n\nThese data will be imported into R using readr::read_csv() for efficient loading and analysis.\nFIPS codes may be used to merge datasets.",

It was identified that the county_fips column had 52 missing values, while all other variables were complete.\n\n\nRows with missing county_fips values were extracted and examined. It was observed that these rows corresponded to non-county entities, such as STATEWIDE WRITEIN: Aggregate votes for write-in candidates across a state. MAINE UOCAVA: Special votes under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. FEDERAL PRECINCT: Votes from federal precincts, often representing overseas or military ballots. These rows do not represent actual counties and therefore lack valid county_fips codes.\n\n\nSince the rows with missing county_fips do not correspond to geographic counties, they were considered irrelevant for a county-level analysis.
