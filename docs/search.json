    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe United States has long been a focal point for political studies, and its elections are often seen as a reflection of broader societal dynamics. What fascinates us most is how electoral outcomes are not just determined at the state level, as popularly perceived, but also exhibit nuanced and often striking trends at the county level. After conducting preliminary research, we noticed consistent patterns in voting behavior that align with specific socioeconomic factors, even when accounting for regional diversity.\nWe are interested in exploring the relationship between these socioeconomic indicators and the presidential election majorities at the county level. For instance, how do income disparities correlate with shifts in political preferences? Are counties with higher poverty rates more likely to lean toward one political party, and how has this evolved over time? Similarly, we want to investigate whether education levels or employment rates play a more significant role in shaping voter turnout and preferences in certain regions. By focusing on granular data at the county level, we aim to uncover how local socioeconomic conditions contribute to the broader political landscape.",

    "text": "The dataset, countypres_2000-2020.csv, provides county-level presidential election returns from 2000 to 2020. It is sourced from official state election data records and hosted on the Harvard Dataverse. The dataset was last updated on June 8, 2021.\nThe dataset, Education.csv, provides information on county-level educational attainment data from 1970 to 2022. It is sourced from the USDA Economic Research Service’s County-Level Data Sets, available USDA. The dataset was last updated on June 20, 2024.\nThe dataset, Unemployment.csv, provides county-level unemployment rates from 2000 to 2022. It is sourced from the USDA Economic Research Service’s County-Level Data Sets, available USDA. The dataset was last updated on June 20, 2024.\n\n\n2.1.1 Data Overview\n\nThe dataset, countypres_2000-2020.csv, contains the following variables:\n\n\nyear: election year\nstate: state name\nstate_po: U.S. postal code state abbreviation\ncounty_name: county name\ncounty_fips: county FIPS code\noffice: President\ncandidate: name of the candidate\nparty: party of the candidate; takes form of DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN, GREEN, LIBERTARIAN, or OTHER\ncandidatevotes: votes received by this candidate for this particular party\ntotalvotes: total number of votes cast in this county-year\nmode: mode of ballots cast; default is TOTAL, with different modes specified for 2020\nversion: date when dataset was finalized\n\n\nThe dataset, Education.csv, contains the following variables:\n\n\nFIPS Code: FIPS code\nState: state abbreviation\nArea name: name of state or county\nAttribute: educational metric\nValue: The corresponding value for the educational metric, typically as a percentage or count\n\n\nThe dataset, Unemployment.csv, contains the following variables:\n\n\nFIPS_Code: FIPS code\nState: state abbreviation\nArea_Name: name of state or county\nAttribute: unemployment-related metric\nValue: The corresponding value for the unemployment metric, typically as a percentage or count\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Issues or Problems\n\ncountypres_2000-2020.csv: County results in Alaska for 2004 are based on official Alaska data, but it is clear the district returns significantly overstate the number of votes cast. In Alaska, the county_fips field stores a combination of state FIPS code and district.\nEducation.csv: Some attribute labels are ambiguous and may require clarification or mapping to standardized educational metrics.\nUnemployment.csv: Inconsistencies in the naming of attributes could pose challenges in aligning the data with other sources.\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Data Import Plan\n\nThese data will be imported into R using readr::read_csv() for efficient loading and analysis.\nFIPS codes may be used to merge datasets.",
