    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe United States has long been a focal point for political studies, and its elections are often seen as a reflection of broader societal dynamics. What fascinates us most is how electoral outcomes are not just determined at the state level, as popularly perceived, but also exhibit nuanced and often striking trends at the county level. After conducting preliminary research, we noticed consistent patterns in voting behavior that align with specific socioeconomic factors, even when accounting for regional diversity.\nWe are interested in exploring the relationship between these socioeconomic indicators and the presidential election majorities at the county level. For instance, how do income disparities correlate with shifts in political preferences? Are counties with higher poverty rates more likely to lean toward one political party, and how has this evolved over time? Similarly, we want to investigate whether education levels or employment rates play a more significant role in shaping voter turnout and preferences in certain regions. By focusing on granular data at the county level, we aim to uncover how local socioeconomic conditions contribute to the broader political landscape.",

This reflects the competitive nature of these regions and their importance in deciding presidential elections. The Northeast and West have consistently fewer swing counties, reflecting more stable party preferences in these regions. This aligns with the historical dominance of Democrats in the Northeast and a mix of Democratic and Republican strongholds in the West.\nAcross all regions, the number of swing counties peaked in the 2008 election. This suggests significant shifts in voter preferences, possibly due to socioeconomic factors or the unique dynamics of that election. Starting in 2012, the number of swing counties has steadily decreased across all regions, indicating that voting patterns have become more entrenched and less likely to change between elections.\n\n\n3.3.2 Implications:\nThe high number of swing counties in the Midwest and South highlights these regions as critical battlegrounds in U.S. presidential elections.

There is no dramatic shift in how income affects voting trends over time. Both major parties (Democrat and Republican) receive votes from counties across all income ranges, indicating that household income is not the sole factor influencing voting behavior.\nRepublican counties tend to cluster in higher vote percentage ranges, often above 50%, especially in lower-income brackets. Democratic votes are more evenly distributed across the income spectrum, suggesting a broader appeal across different economic groups.\nBoth parties have regions where they dominate, shown by clusters of points with vote percentages nearing 100%. These likely represent party strongholds. Lower-income counties show significant Republican support, while higher-income counties exhibit more variability in voting patterns, with both parties competing for support.\n\n\n3.4.2 Implications:\nWhile income may influence voting trends in some cases, other factors (e.g., regional culture, education, or urbanization) likely play a more significant role in shaping political preferences.

    "text": "3.5 Average Vote Share Over Time by Income Group\n\n3.5.1 Trends Over Time:\nFrom 2004 through 2016, the Republican Party generally held a higher average vote share across all income groups, maintaining a solid lead in high- and middle-income counties and gradually improving their standing among low-income counties. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party’s support remained relatively steady over this period, generally lagging behind Republicans but not experiencing large swings. Both parties showed relative stability, with Republicans consistently commanding the largest share in wealthier areas and Democrats holding a modest but persistent presence across all income levels.\nHowever, by 2020, there is a marked and sudden decrease in the average vote share for both major parties in every income group. This drop is notable because it breaks the previously steady patterns observed in earlier years. The previously clear Republican advantage and the Democrats’ steady, if smaller, portion of the vote share both diminish sharply.\n\n\n3.5.2 Implications:\nWhile previous election cycles showed relatively stable income-based patterns—Republicans faring better in wealthier counties and Democrats maintaining consistent support across income levels—the 2020 data stands out as a significant departure. Several unique, real-world factors from that election year may have contributed to this shift:\n\nCOVID-19 and the Economy: The pandemic caused job losses, closed businesses, and made remote work common, shaking up normal economic patterns. This uncertainty may have weakened the usual link between income and voting, as people from all income levels reconsidered their political choices.\nSocial and Political Tension: Intense social unrest and racial justice protests in 2020 shifted voters’ focus away from economic issues. Instead of voting based mainly on income, many voters cared more about how parties and candidates responded to social and health crises, changing traditional voting habits.\nChanges in Voting Methods: Early voting, mail-in ballots, and a record turnout brought more diverse voters into the process. Combined with a highly charged media environment and deep political divisions, these new voting conditions encouraged some voters to stray from their typical patterns. As a result, both major parties lost some support across all income groups in 2020.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Ensure Median_Household_Income is numeric\nmajor_parties_clean &lt;- major_parties_clean |&gt;\n  mutate(Median_Household_Income = as.numeric(gsub(\",\", \"\", as.character(Median_Household_Income))))\n\n# Define income quantiles (e.g., low, medium, high)\nquantiles &lt;- quantile(major_parties_clean$Median_Household_Income, probs = c(0.33, 0.67), na.rm = TRUE)\nlow_threshold &lt;- quantiles[1]\nhigh_threshold &lt;- quantiles[2]\n\nmajor_parties_time &lt;- major_parties_clean |&gt;\n  mutate(income_group = case_when(\n    Median_Household_Income &lt;= low_threshold ~ \"Low Income\",\n    Median_Household_Income &gt; low_threshold & Median_Household_Income &lt;= high_threshold ~ \"Middle Income\",\n    Median_Household_Income &gt; high_threshold ~ \"High Income\"\n  )) |&gt;\n  group_by(year, party, income_group) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_vote_share = mean(party_vote_percentage, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nparty_colors &lt;- c(\n  \"DEMOCRAT\" = \"blue\",\n  \"REPUBLICAN\" = \"red\"\n)\n\nggplot(major_parties_time, aes(x = year, y = avg_vote_share, color = party, group = party)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  facet_wrap(~ income_group) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = party_colors) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Vote Share Over Time by Income Group\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Average Vote Share (%)\",\n    color = \"Party\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")",

    "text": "3.6 Voting Trends in High vs. Low Unemployment Counties\n\n3.6.1 Trends Over Time:\nCounties with both high and low unemployment consistently show stronger support for the Republican party. This trend persists across all election years (2000–2020). In both high and low unemployment counties, the Democratic party’s average vote percentage declines slightly from 2000 to 2020, indicating a possible shift in voter preferences or party alignment. Third parties, including Libertarian and Green, maintain consistently low support in both high and low unemployment categories, with minor fluctuations in specific years like 2016. While there are small variations, the overall voting patterns for major parties (Republican and Democrat) remain relatively stable in relation to unemployment categories over time.\nThe Republican party consistently shows higher median vote percentages in both high and low unemployment counties. Their vote distribution is wider in high unemployment counties, indicating significant variation in support. The Democratic party has lower median vote percentages compared to Republicans in both categories. The interquartile range (middle 50% of data) for Democrats is narrower, suggesting more consistent levels of support. Third parties (Green, Libertarian, and Others) consistently show very low vote percentages across both categories, with little variation or influence.\n\n\n3.6.2 Implications:\nThese results suggest that unemployment levels may influence voter preferences, with high unemployment areas showing greater dispersion in support for major parties and the Republican party seeing stronger support in economically distressed counties.

    "text": "3.7 Correlation Between Socioeconomic Indicators\n\n3.7.1 Discovery:\nHigh Unemployment Counties: These counties are more likely to show higher Republican vote shares, indicating that unemployment might influence political preferences toward parties promising economic recovery or change. Low Unemployment Counties: Tend to exhibit relatively balanced or higher Democratic vote shares, suggesting that stability in employment may align with Democratic policies in those regions.\nLower-Income Counties: Both Democratic and Republican support exist, but Democratic votes are more evenly spread across lower-income brackets. This suggests that Democrats have a broader appeal across lower socioeconomic strata. Higher-Income Counties: A stronger concentration of Republican votes emerges as income levels increase, reflecting an alignment with Republican fiscal policies or tax preferences.\nThere’s a clear socioeconomic divide in voting trends. Republican support appears stronger in high-unemployment and high-income areas, while Democratic support is more consistent in lower-income and lower-unemployment regions. This polarization reflects how different economic issues resonate with voter bases of each party.\nCounties with mid-range unemployment and income levels might serve as swing regions, as both parties demonstrate vote shares in these demographics.\n\n\n3.7.2 Implications:\nThese demonstrate the strong influence of socioeconomic factors like unemployment and income on voting behavior.

The Democratic vote share at higher education levels seems to grow more pronounced in later years.\n\nMinor Parties (Green, Libertarian, and Other):\n\nMinor parties like Green (green dots) and Libertarian (gray dots) maintain a low vote share across all levels of education.Their distribution appears consistent across counties and years, which suggests they do not have a strong correlation with education levels.\n\nOverall Spread:\n\nIn counties with a wide range of education levels (from 25% to 75%), both Democrats and Republicans capture significant portions of the vote share, which highlights competitive voting dynamics in these regions.\n\n\nCode\n#Loading data sets\npres_res &lt;- read.csv(\"countypres_2000-2020.csv\")\nunemployment_data &lt;- read.csv(\"Unemployment.csv\")\neducation_data &lt;- read.csv(\"Education.csv\")\nsaipe_04 &lt;- read.csv(\"est04ALL.csv\")\nsaipe_08 &lt;- read.csv(\"est08ALL.csv\")\nsaipe_12 &lt;- read.csv(\"est12ALL.csv\")\nsaipe_16 &lt;- read.csv(\"est16ALL.csv\")\nsaipe_20 &lt;- read.csv(\"est20ALL.csv\")\n\n# Add a year column to the education data based on the Attribute\neducation_data &lt;- education_data |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    year = case_when(\n      grepl(\"2000$\", Attribute) ~ 2000,\n      grepl(\"2008-12$\", Attribute) ~ 2012,\n      grepl(\"2018-22$\", Attribute) ~ 2020,\n      TRUE ~ NA_integer_\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(year)) #

    "text": "3.10 Parallel Coordinates of Socioeconomic Factors & Vote Share (2020)\nSince 2020 was marked by numerous significant events—such as the COVID-19 pandemic, social unrest, shifting political landscapes, and widespread business closures—we will narrow our analysis to this year. Our goal is to examine the correlation between socioeconomic factors and the vote share for each major political party during this particular election year.\n\n3.10.1 Discovery:\nFor both Democrats and Republicans, the lines are densely packed and intermixed. If there was a clear, linear relationship—such as high Democratic vote share occurring primarily in high-education, low-unemployment counties—we would see more distinct patterns (e.g., lines consistently slanting upward or downward together). Instead, the mass of overlapping lines suggests that counties with varying vote shares are distributed across the full range of these socioeconomic indicators.\nBoth sets of parallel coordinates plots for 2020 suggest that neither party’s vote share is tightly linked to these socioeconomic variables in a simple, linear way. While there may be nuanced relationships that require more detailed statistical analysis, the parallel coordinates visualization alone shows that in 2020, Democratic and Republican vote shares span a broad range of income, unemployment, and education levels without forming a clear, easily discernible pattern of correlation.\n\n\n3.10.2 Implications:\nSeveral theories might explain why the 2020 election results do not show a simple, linear relationship between socioeconomic indicators and voting patterns when viewed through these parallel coordinates plots:\n\nNon-Economic Factors: Beyond income, education, and unemployment, cultural, social, and identity-based influences—like religion, urban/rural divides, and racial composition—shape voting. In 2020, events like the pandemic and social unrest overshadowed purely economic considerations.\nPartisan Realignment and Polarization: Growing polarization has made voters more loyal to parties for ideological or cultural reasons, reducing the impact of local economic conditions on their choices.\nComplexity of Socioeconomic Profiles: Counties are diverse. High-income or well-educated areas still contain varied subgroups with different voting patterns, which obscures simple correlations.\nCOVID-19 as a Disruptive Factor: The pandemic shifted priorities from typical economic metrics to public health and crisis management, complicating straightforward economic-voting links.\nMedia Fragmentation and Information Ecosystems: Diverse, polarized media environments influence voters more than local socioeconomic indicators, shaping opinions and choices independently.\nAggregation Effects and Data Granularity: County-level averages hide internal differences.

    "text": "The study of how socioeconomic factors influence voting trends in U.S. presidential elections from 2000 to 2020 uncovered interesting patterns. While regional differences and party strongholds stayed steady, voter behavior is influenced by many factors. No single socioeconomic factor—like income, unemployment, or education—can fully explain voting trends. A closer look at the 2020 elections using parallel coordinates analysis showed how these factors interact but didn’t reveal clear, simple patterns. This highlights how complex voter preferences are.\nKey findings include the importance of regional context, the changing role of swing counties, and the impact of events like the COVID-19 pandemic. Income and unemployment showed some connection to voting preferences, but these were often linked with other regional factors. Education stood out as a strong predictor of Democratic support, especially in counties with more college-educated voters.\nOur study had some limitations, such as relying on county-level data, which can miss smaller, detailed trends. In fact, future research could use more detailed data and include other factors like race, religion, urbanization, and policy changes to gain deeper insights. The findings emphasize the need for thoughtful analysis that looks at how different factors combine, therefore providing useful information for policymakers, researchers, and political strategists to better understand and address the needs of diverse communities.",
