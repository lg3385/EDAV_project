# Introduction

The United States has long been a focal point for political studies, and its elections are often seen as a reflection of broader societal dynamics. What fascinates us most is how electoral outcomes are not just determined at the state level, as popularly perceived, but also exhibit nuanced and often striking trends at the county level. After conducting preliminary research, we noticed consistent patterns in voting behavior that align with specific socioeconomic factors, even when accounting for regional diversity.

We are interested in exploring the relationship between these socioeconomic indicators and the presidential election majorities at the county level. For instance, how do income disparities correlate with shifts in political preferences? Are counties with higher poverty rates more likely to lean toward one political party, and how has this evolved over time? Similarly, we want to investigate whether education levels or employment rates play a more significant role in shaping voter turnout and preferences in certain regions. By focusing on granular data at the county level, we aim to uncover how local socioeconomic conditions contribute to the broader political landscape.
