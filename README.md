# Socioeconomic Influences on County-Level Voting Trends in Presidential Elections

This project investigates how socioeconomic factors have shaped voting trends in U.S. presidential elections at the county level from 2000 to 2020. By analyzing data on income, poverty estimates, education levels, and employment rates, the study aims to uncover patterns and potential causal relationships between a county's socioeconomic landscape and its political leanings. The findings could offer valuable insights into the social and economic drivers of electoral behaviors, shedding light on how shifts in socioeconomic conditions influence voter sentiment over two decades.
