# Conclusion

The analysis of socioeconomic factors influencing county-level voting trends in U.S. presidential elections from 2000 to 2020 has revealed significant patterns and complexities. While regional differences and strongholds for major parties remain consistent, the nuances of voter behavior demonstrate that no single socioeconomic variable—such as income, unemployment, or education—entirely explains voting trends. The addition of parallel coordinates analysis for 2020 elections highlighted the interplay of various socioeconomic indicators without revealing clear linear relationships, emphasizing the multifaceted nature of voter preferences.

Key takeaways include the importance of regional context, the evolving role of swing counties, and the influence of external events such as the COVID-19 pandemic on voting behavior.  Income and unemployment demonstrated nuanced correlations with voting preferences, but their impact was often intertwined with other regional factors. Education emerged as a strong predictor of Democratic support, especially in counties with higher college-educated populations.

This study faced limitations, including the use of aggregated county-level data, which may obscure finer-grained relationships. Future research could explore more granular datasets and incorporate additional variables such as race, religion, urbanization, and policy changes to uncover deeper insights. Lessons learned emphasize the need for nuanced analyses that account for the intersection of socioeconomic and non-economic factors, offering valuable guidance for policymakers, researchers, and political strategists seeking to address the diverse needs of U.S. communities.
