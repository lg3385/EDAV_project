# Conclusion

The study of how socioeconomic factors influence voting trends in U.S. presidential elections from 2000 to 2020 uncovered interesting patterns. While regional differences and party strongholds stayed steady, voter behavior is influenced by many factors. No single socioeconomic factor—like income, unemployment, or education—can fully explain voting trends. A closer look at the 2020 elections using parallel coordinates analysis showed how these factors interact but didn’t reveal clear, simple patterns. This highlights how complex voter preferences are.

Key findings include the importance of regional context, the changing role of swing counties, and the impact of events like the COVID-19 pandemic. Income and unemployment showed some connection to voting preferences, but these were often linked with other regional factors. Education stood out as a strong predictor of Democratic support, especially in counties with more college-educated voters.

Our study had some limitations, such as relying on county-level data, which can miss smaller, detailed trends. In fact, future research could use more detailed data and include other factors like race, religion, urbanization, and policy changes to gain deeper insights. The findings emphasize the need for thoughtful analysis that looks at how different factors combine, therefore providing useful information for policymakers, researchers, and political strategists to better understand and address the needs of diverse communities.
